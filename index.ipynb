Very often, the probability of a certain event depends on other events happening! Let's see how this all works in this lab.\n\n## Objectives\n\nYou will be able to:\n\n* Differentiate between independent and dependent events\n* Use the multiplication rule to find the probability of the intersection of two events\n\n## Exercise 1\nA coin is tossed and a single 6-sided dice is rolled.
